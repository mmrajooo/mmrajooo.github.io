<p>Scenario Analysis for Tesla Motors
Mayuresh Rajwadkar
The primary “goal” of Tesla motors is To accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass market electric cars to market as soon as possible.1 To achieve this goal they have a simple plan2,3,
Create a low volume car, which would necessarily be expensive
Use that money to develop a medium volume car at a lower price
Use that money to create an affordable, high volume car
The framework of strategic thinking and execution which Elon follows is extremely entrepreneurial, hence to a majority of observers and analysts, it always appears to be challenging with a number of uncertainties (I would say almost all the time). A very direct insight into Elon’s mindset can be inferred by some of his talks and interviews available online.4
Cars, which are “personal transport devices” have a job to be done of transporting people at their will from point A-point B, to achieve this a majority/most of these devices use “internal combustion engines” which are still today based on the basic design based on the “Carnot&rsquo;s Heat Engine”5 in physics and first commercially developed in 1862 by Étienne Lenoir6, which primarily converts energy in the form of heat to kinetic energy which is used to locomote the car on roads (Internal Combustion Vehicles, ICV). The Electric Motor also a invention of the same period, has evolved considerably over the years relative to the internal combustion engine and  is much more efficient and convert ‘electrical energy’ into kinetic energy which is used then to locomote the car on roads.(Electric Vehicles, EV) The main development in this domain is the actual efficiency of the motors at  converting the energy and also a revolution in control systems in the last 2~3 decades due to the advancements in electronics. The only “lagging” piece of technology for enablement is the lack of efficient storage of electrical  energy, in a format which can be used in cars.
ICV’s have seen incremental developments over the years, and has built up an economy of an industry of fossil fuels, industry of ICV manufacturers and political/international gridlock around these industries. The ICV industry is primarily a function of crude oil prices, if the crude oil prices are low, the industry booms and if the prices go high then it falls, as we have seen in the oil crisis when the price per gallon of crude oil went up from <del>$30/barrel to <del>$100/barrel. The technological capabilities of the ICV’s are pretty much in saturation and not much can be gained to make economic sense. The problem is only aggravated by a concern of Climate Change and also the worry of a limited supply of fossil fuels.
EV’s, are a very new player in the field, companies have innovated in developing electric cars before Tesla, but for whatever reason they have only remained of academic interest. Tesla on the other hand has gone ahead on the challenge and has been pretty successful in bringing a capable electric car into the market, with the Model-S. The efficiency of  electrical energy storage is based off 2 factors, a. the energy density per unit weight and b. the “recycle time” (charging time) for the energy storage unit in use. There are a number of technologies in development at this time7, like Li-Ion(current), Li-S, Li-Air(future). Li-Air, is the most promising technology but as the paper7 talks, it will come to fruit only around 2030</del>2040 and will actually make it very feasible for EV’s to overtake ICV’s in 2040</del>2050. These technologies determine the economics of Electrical Energy Storage technologies.
Tesla CEO, Elon Musk is well aware of this fact and cites this in his talk referenced below. 4 (min 21:25). Autonomous cars however are not so far into the future and we should see technologies which would enable this in the next ~10 years.</p>

Newell Company: Corporate Strategy</p>
<p>9-799-139
REV: JANUARY 31, 2005</p>
<p>Newell Company: Corporate Strategy,
Mayuresh Rajwadkar
Core Question:
Can Newell extend its expertise in acquiring, streamlining and managing small companies, to the acquisition of the giant and mismanaged Rubbermaid ?
R1: Revamping Management and Operations
Rubbermaid has had a number of management and operations issues at time of acquisition, Joe and his management team, should reshuffle the management team which comes over from Rubbermaid, and strategically layoff and cut staff with an aim to make it more profitable. The management which stays after the restructuring should undergo a through training to realign with the strategy and goals of Newell. The Product portfolio and operations also should be reconsidered and should be strategically cut down in order to optimize cost vs sales. Newell has a very disciplined and successful strategy with product management and operations and should be applied to all the Rubbermaid products, after the merger. A cut on the product portfolio will also improve the performance of the operations and overall customer experience.
R2: Improving Customer Service
Hand in hand with R1, the company should focus on improving its relationship with its customers. In the case the existing customers are not satisfied with Rubbermaid at the time of its acquisition. Newell, should  work with them closely, to bring back confidence and convince them that the support would improve with the new management. Newell should also make an extra effort to reach out to the customers who already have left and try to renegotiate to bring them back into their portfolio with Rubbermaid.
R3: Improving supply chain management and production efficacy.
Newell, with its bigger size after the acquisition, can have better leverage in negotiating with theits supply chains. This will help in reducing production costs not only for Rubbermaid but also for its other product lines. A reduced cost structure will help the company compete better in the market. A reduced cost structure will also help the company refine its production efficiency and complement its customer service experience. Joe, and his management team should be insistant to use this leverage<br />
initially with all the Rubbermaid products, and later as they seem fit on its other product lines.</p>
