We are looking for a carpool for 2018-19 school year for our daughter

<!--more-->
My daughter JUI is in Thacher UE. We live in Stoughton, just behind 
[Polillios Garden Center](https://www.polillios.com/ "Polillios Garden Center")
[Location on google map](https://goo.gl/maps/w11MGRf7h6t)

There are two or three options, the Thacher preferred one is carpooling.

### Carpooling
We have a van, and I am open to driving other kids to the school in the morning, 
however I need a carpool to bring my daughter back from school. I am not sure
of the timing but it would be either the usual dismissal at 3:15 or the aftercare 
at 4:45 depending on what activites are offered.  I would really appreciate if 
we could find one or more famililies who could work with us. 

### School Bus 
I also tried to talk to one of the school bus companies(YCN Transportation), 
but they will not work with individual parents but with the school. 
If we have a sizeable group of parents in the local area near us, we could some
how talk to the Thacher management and see if any deal can be negotiated with one or
more of the school bus companies. I have time and I will volunteer to drive this 
with the school and the bus companies if this is feasible. 

### Hiring a driver/babysitter
In this option we could hire a baby sitter/driver to drive our kids home from
school. We would share the cost of the pay for the driver. If there are more kids
in the pool and the driver is capabile of driving my mini-van, I will also look into
the option of buying another car so I can volunteer my VAN exclusively for driving the 
kids home. 

Again thanks for any help in advance.
