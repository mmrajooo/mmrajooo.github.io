## About me

![This is me](/img/hs-mmr-b3-2.jpg)

I spend most of my time working with early-stage companies and ambitious teams who are trying to turn sharp ideas into durable businesses. My interests span health, education, transportation, and infrastructure, but I care less about a specific sector and more about whether there is a real problem, a thoughtful model, and a team that can execute. Over the years, this has meant countless conversations about go‑to‑market, pricing, fundraising, and what it actually takes to build something that lasts.

My background sits at the intersection of semiconductor design and cloud infrastructure, where complex technical systems meet real-world constraints around time, cost, and scale. I specialize in high‑performance computing environments tuned for demanding engineering workloads, and have helped organizations bridge traditional on‑premise methodologies with cloud‑native architectures. That work has given me a front-row seat to how technology, capital, and execution interact inside high‑stakes projects.

On the engineering side, I have deep experience with ASIC design flows, physical design, and the infrastructure that supports modern semiconductor development. I have architected automation systems that streamline chip design and qualification, partnering closely with both infrastructure and design teams to reduce bottlenecks and improve reliability. That combination of technical depth and business focus shapes how I evaluate opportunities, which teams I choose to work with, and how I help them make better strategic decisions.

I split my time across hubs like Boston, Austin, and the SF Bay Area, where I enjoy connecting with founders, operators, and builders at different stages of the journey. Whether the conversation starts with architecture diagrams or financial models, the goal is the same: to understand where the leverage is, and how to use it well.
