In the good old days of the last century and early this century I used to run a small blog
or a resource page about VLSI (Very Large Scale Integrated) circuit design and resources.
The blog is still hosted on blogspot but I have stopped maintaining it. This post summarizes
some of its relevant content which may still be useful for folks.
