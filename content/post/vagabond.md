**This Blog is still under heavy contruction...  I hope to go live soon in Aug 2019 In the meantime I have my old blog all  summarised in this one post here**

I had studied this poem by R. L. Stevenson when I was in high school, it was my favorite and is a great source of
inspiration.

```
Give to me the life I love,  
  Let the lave go by me,  
Give the jolly heaven above 
  And the byway night me.  
Bed in the bush with stars to see,  
  Bread I dip in the river --  
There's the life for a man like me,  
  There's the life for ever.  

Let the blow fall soon or late, 
  Let what will be o'er me; 
Give the face of earth around 
  And the road before me.  
Wealth I seek not, hope nor love,  
  Nor a friend to know me;  
All I seek, the heaven above  
  And the road below me.

Or let autumn fall on me  
  Where afield I linger,  
Silencing the bird on tree, 
  Biting the blue finger; 
White as meal the frosty field -- 
  Warm the fireside haven -- 
Not to autumn will I yield,  
  Not to winter even!

Let the blow fall soon or late, 
  Let what will be o'er me; 
Give the face of earth around, 
  And the road before me.  
Wealth I ask not, hope, nor love,  
  Nor a friend to know me.  
All I ask, the heaven above  
  And the road below me.
