We are looking for a carpool for 2018-19 school year for our daughter

<!--more-->
My daughter JUI is in Thacher UE. We live in Stoughton, just behind 
[Polillios Garden Center](https://www.polillios.com/ "Polillios Garden Center")
[Location on google map](https://goo.gl/maps/w11MGRf7h6t)

There are two or three options, the Thacher preferred one is carpooling.

### Carpooling
We have a van, and I am open to driving other kids to the school in the morning, 
however I need a carpool to bring my daughter back from school. I am not sure
of the timing but it would be either the usual dismissal at 3:15 or the aftercare 
at 4:45 depending on what activites are offered.  I would really appreciate if 
we could find one or more famililies who could work with us. 

### School Bus 
I also tried to talk to one of the school bus companies(YCN Transportation), 
but they will not work with individual parents but with the school. 
If we have a sizeable group of parents in the local area near us, we could some
how talk to the Thacher management and see if any deal can be negotiated with one or
more of the school bus companies. I have time and I will volunteer to drive this 
with the school and the bus companies if this is feasible. 

### Hiring a driver/babysitter
In this option we could hire a baby sitter/driver to drive our kids home from
school. We would share the cost of the pay for the driver. If there are more kids
in the pool and the driver is capabile of driving my mini-van, I will also look into
the option of buying another car so I can volunteer my VAN exclusively for driving the 
kids home. 

Again thanks for any help in advance.

Ever since I started on my MBA Journey with the HBX CORe, followed by HBX
Disruptive Strategy  with no other than Prof Christiansen himself, I have
cycled through many iterations of the "Jobs to be done" approach, the "IDEO
Human centered design process" and finally the "Designing for Growth: A Design
Thinking Tool Kit". This brings out a very innovative design process which I
believe I have practiced over and over again during my entire MBA experience at
Babson. This course enabled me to use these methods in a completely new design
environment and offered the invaluable opportunity to work with teammates from
Sweden. The course also provided exposure to working in a foreign country and
culture with its own laws (case in point, the MachMyra challenge) 

I have some experience working with foreign mates when I was in the Silicon
Valley, and in Bangalore, however I have never worked in Europe directly. One
of the reasons of electing for this course is that sometime in the uncertain
future I do want to move to Europe. This experience has given me a lot more
friends and network primarily in Sweden, which should be a very good start. I
believe this will be a only thing on my resume/profile which could make me
stand out when I apply for a job in Europe in the future. I hope to build on
the relationships started during the course and may be something good may work
out in the future.
