My first exposure to business was when I was probably in middle and high school. 
My dad worked as a engineer most of his life in [Siemens India](https://www.siemens.com/in/en/home.html) and left his job
to establish his own venture to consult and implement industrial power systems and switchgear
in Mumbai in the eighties.

I recall very little from those times, but I remember that we used to bid on indian government contracts
for work. We used to prepare detailed estimates for the work and come up with the bid. I used to collect
information on supply chain pricing. There was no internet and most work used to be old-school looking up
yellow pages, industry directories, making phone calls by literally dialing numbers on a circular phone dial
(if anyone still remembers what it used to beo). It used to be fun work besides the usual school drudgery. 
We used to have a small commercial space, where we used to run a small shop and I had dabbled into
operating the retail sales and service, customers and inventory of the store.
Our business sustained only for a few years but was later bogged down due to a number of reasons, 
related to medical issues in the family, red-tape and corruption in the government contracts, etc. It was not an easy
game in those days where India was a lot more socialist in its governence processes. 


Mumbai is the financial capital of India. The [Bombay Stock Exchange](https://www.bseindia.com/) is the oldest
stock exchange in Asia, established in 1875. We used to have a small portfolio of investments and I had a early
introduction of how Stock, Bonds and Debentures are issued and traded in Corporate India. Financial estimation
and prediction in those times (late eighties/early nineties) was mostly speculation and very little financial
relative to how it is today.
