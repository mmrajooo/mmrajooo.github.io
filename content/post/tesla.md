Scenario Analysis for Tesla Motors
Mayuresh Rajwadkar 
The primary “goal” of Tesla motors is To accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass market electric cars to market as soon as possible.1 To achieve this goal they have a simple plan2,3, 
Create a low volume car, which would necessarily be expensive
Use that money to develop a medium volume car at a lower price
Use that money to create an affordable, high volume car
The framework of strategic thinking and execution which Elon follows is extremely entrepreneurial, hence to a majority of observers and analysts, it always appears to be challenging with a number of uncertainties (I would say almost all the time). A very direct insight into Elon’s mindset can be inferred by some of his talks and interviews available online.4 
	Cars, which are “personal transport devices” have a job to be done of transporting people at their will from point A-point B, to achieve this a majority/most of these devices use “internal combustion engines” which are still today based on the basic design based on the “Carnot's Heat Engine”5 in physics and first commercially developed in 1862 by Étienne Lenoir6, which primarily converts energy in the form of heat to kinetic energy which is used to locomote the car on roads (Internal Combustion Vehicles, ICV). The Electric Motor also a invention of the same period, has evolved considerably over the years relative to the internal combustion engine and  is much more efficient and convert ‘electrical energy’ into kinetic energy which is used then to locomote the car on roads.(Electric Vehicles, EV) The main development in this domain is the actual efficiency of the motors at  converting the energy and also a revolution in control systems in the last 2~3 decades due to the advancements in electronics. The only “lagging” piece of technology for enablement is the lack of efficient storage of electrical  energy, in a format which can be used in cars. 
	ICV’s have seen incremental developments over the years, and has built up an economy of an industry of fossil fuels, industry of ICV manufacturers and political/international gridlock around these industries. The ICV industry is primarily a function of crude oil prices, if the crude oil prices are low, the industry booms and if the prices go high then it falls, as we have seen in the oil crisis when the price per gallon of crude oil went up from ~$30/barrel to ~$100/barrel. The technological capabilities of the ICV’s are pretty much in saturation and not much can be gained to make economic sense. The problem is only aggravated by a concern of Climate Change and also the worry of a limited supply of fossil fuels. 
EV’s, are a very new player in the field, companies have innovated in developing electric cars before Tesla, but for whatever reason they have only remained of academic interest. Tesla on the other hand has gone ahead on the challenge and has been pretty successful in bringing a capable electric car into the market, with the Model-S. The efficiency of  electrical energy storage is based off 2 factors, a. the energy density per unit weight and b. the “recycle time” (charging time) for the energy storage unit in use. There are a number of technologies in development at this time7, like Li-Ion(current), Li-S, Li-Air(future). Li-Air, is the most promising technology but as the paper7 talks, it will come to fruit only around 2030~2040 and will actually make it very feasible for EV’s to overtake ICV’s in 2040~2050. These technologies determine the economics of Electrical Energy Storage technologies. 
Tesla CEO, Elon Musk is well aware of this fact and cites this in his talk referenced below. 4 (min 21:25). Autonomous cars however are not so far into the future and we should see technologies which would enable this in the next ~10 years.

The strategic implication however to consider is if Autonomous Driving are going to be reality, sooner, should one wait for the battery technology to evolve another 20 years, before we can compare “apples” to “apples”, I mean EV’s to ICV’s  as they mean to us today, or will the business environment quickly adapt to autonomous driving  and its consequences.  We are already seeing how Uber is disrupting the “short term rental” or taxi industry where drivers are sharing their cars with their peers. If Tesla can get on early into the autonomous car industry, there is already an idea where Tesla owners will be able to “rent out” their vehicles autonomously while they are at work, which would pay back some or most of the cost of the expensive vehicles, if that happens may be the affordability of a $100K car could be almost the same as a $20K car. One more factor to not ignore here is that the “electric motor” is a different technology than a internal combustion engine, the motors used in  Tesla can easily drive the car to about 400K miles or more, whereas the conventional ICV’ run only to about 200K or less on an average, added to this the car uses extremely advanced materials in its construction which also give its mechanical structure a longer life. This would mean that the life of a Tesla EV car would be 3-4 times a normal ICV. This brings us to the next scenario relative to

Car Sharing.
Summary: 
It is a bit hard to put a proper time horizon on battery technology as this is a very long 20-30 year window, however autonomous driving will happen within the next 10 years. I proposed two scenarios to explain this. Given the 10 year window, in the former scenario of electrical energy storage technologies, Tesla (and similar other companies) will be in the NE=>SE quadrant. Tesla’s current strategy of the “gigafactory” for battery manufacturing is a step in the direction of “making electrical energy storage cheap”, Whether or not they can do it  we do not know, but Elon Musk is to some extent creating market for batteries, so that other companies can compete with technology and move in that direction. If cheaper solutions are attained, the the demand for crude oil will reduce and its prices will also go down, and ICV’s can be a threat, however if the world economy moves in the direction of “carbon taxation” then there will be lesser incentives for ICV’s and EV’s will eventually win the game. This will most likely not happen in the 10 year window but is a more long term strategy. The second scenario considers Autonomous Driving Cars. The main issue with Autonomous cars is more legal and political than technical, these factors would actually would tend to make the NW quadrant more lucrative, where car sharing and autonomous driving would work together, EV’s will win over ICV’s in this scenario due to their technical superiority and longer life even if they cost more due to the lag of electrical storage technologies.
