One of the goals of the Sweden Elective from Babson was about applying the techniques of Design thinking 
with a  "Jobs To Be Done" approach to the design challenge of the course.

Ever since I started on my MBA Journey with the HBX CORe, followed by HBX
Disruptive Strategy  with no other than Prof Christiansen himself, I have
cycled through many iterations of the "Jobs to be done" approach, the "IDEO
Human centered design process" and finally the "Designing for Growth: A Design
Thinking Tool Kit". This brings out a very innovative design process which I
believe I have practiced over and over again during my entire MBA experience at
Babson. This course enabled me to use these methods in a completely new design
environment and offered the invaluable opportunity to work with teammates from
Sweden. The course also provided exposure to working in a foreign country and
culture with its own laws (case in point, the MachMyra challenge) 

I have some experience working with foreign mates when I was in the Silicon
Valley, and in Bangalore, however I have never worked in Europe directly. One
of the reasons of electing for this course is that sometime in the uncertain
future I do want to move to Europe. This experience has given me a lot more
friends and network primarily in Sweden, which should be a very good start. I
believe this will be a only thing on my resume/profile which could make me
stand out when I apply for a job in Europe in the future. I hope to build on
the relationships started during the course and may be something good may work
out in the future.
