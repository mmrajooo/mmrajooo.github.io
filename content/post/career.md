I've been fortunate to earn multiple graduate degrees across different disciplines. Looking back at my journey—from being the troublemaker who would have given my middle and high school teachers heart attacks, to becoming a lifelong learner—the common thread has been pursuing subjects that genuinely fascinated me. Early in my career, I received excellent mentorship that taught me how to navigate academic environments, a skill I've applied throughout my professional life.

I am proud to be an alumnus of [UC Berkeley Haas School of Business](https://haas.berkeley.edu/), [F.W. Olin Graduate School of Business at Babson College](https://www.babson.edu/academics/graduate-school/), [Harvard Business School Online](https://online.hbs.edu/), [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/), and [The University of Mumbai](http://www.mu.ac.in/).

#### Early Education in Mumbai

I began my education in Mumbai at schools operated by the [Indian Education Society](http://www.ies.edu), specifically [Padmakar Dhamdhere English Medium Primary School](http://iespdemp.in/) and [V. N. Sule Guruji English Medium School](http://www.iesvns.com/) (also known as King George or Raja Shivaji Vidyasankul). All my schooling was conducted in English—what we call English-medium education in India, similar to English immersion programs in the United States.

#### Undergraduate Studies in Physics

I continued my education at [Elphinstone College](https://www.elphinstone.ac.in/), where I completed high school and the first two years of undergraduate studies. I then earned my Bachelor's degree in Physics from [Mithibai College](http://www.mithibai.ac.in/Department%20of%20Physics/M__471). Both colleges are affiliated with the [University of Mumbai](http://www.mu.ac.in/).

#### The Turning Point: Graduate Physics Lectures

A pivotal moment came through the *Lectures in Graduate Physics* program at the [Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education](http://www.hbcse.tifr.res.in/). These lectures provided rigorous training in problem-solving techniques for physics and mathematics, establishing a solid foundation for understanding relativity, quantum mechanics, and general relativity. [Padma Shri Prof. Arvind Kumar](https://www.hbcse.tifr.res.in/people/former-members/prof-arvind-kumar) was a key mentor during this period, along with [Prof. H. C. Pradhan](http://www.hbcse.tifr.res.in/people/former-members/hcpradhan) and other faculty members. This training proved instrumental in helping me qualify for the highly competitive IIT Bombay Physics entrance examination. 

#### Master's in Physics at IIT Bombay (1994-1996)

I enrolled in the Master's program in Physics at [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/) in 1994. A highlight of the program was my summer internship at the [Society for Applied Microwave Electronics Engineering and Research (SAMEER)](https://www.sameer.gov.in/), where I assisted scientist [Prakash Suratkar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prakash-suratkar-45237a7/) in his research on infrared lasers. This internship also connected me with the condensed matter physics group at the [Tata Institute of Fundamental Research](http://www.tifr.res.in/~dcmpms/index.php), then led by [Prof. B. M. Arora](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/bmarora).

The collaborative environment among my cohort—particularly with fellow students [Mayur Joshi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mayur-vinod-joshi-9996182) and [Ashish Thapliyal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashishthapliyal/)—proved invaluable. Our "M.Sc. Physics Team" supported each other through rigorous preparation, and nearly all of us achieved high percentile scores on the GATE 1996 exam, opening doors to applied sciences programs. I was accepted into IIT Bombay's Electrical Engineering program, IIT Madras's Materials Science program, and also received a PhD position in the Experimental Condensed Matter Physics group at TIFR. During this period, I developed an experimental setup for measuring photoconductivity of diamond thin films, working alongside doctoral student [Tarun Sharda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarunsharda/).

#### Master's in Microelectronics/Electrical Engineering at IIT Bombay (1996-1998)

In 1996, I enrolled in the Master's program in Microelectronics/Electrical Engineering at [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/). Beyond the standard coursework, I worked on a research project modeling the endurance of flash memory devices. The project was initially sponsored by [Intel](https://www.intel.com/) but later lost funding. I completed the program and graduated in early 1998.

#### Early Career in Semiconductors

After completing my graduate studies, I joined Duet Technologies and began my career in the semiconductor industry. Over the next two decades, I worked at Philips, Chiplogic (which was acquired by Analog Devices), and then across three Analog Devices design centers in California, Texas, and Massachusetts. During this period, I developed deep expertise in physical design and foundry CAD, along with substantial work in architecting digital electronic design‑automation flows, high‑performance computing infrastructure, and Linux systems.

As the global economy moved through a major downturn, the semiconductor industry underwent significant consolidation. The design‑automation niche that had originally attracted me became increasingly dominated by a few large EDA vendors—Synopsys, Cadence, and Mentor (later part of Siemens)—while a growing share of design work migrated outside the United States. As my technical specialization became more commoditized and geographically dispersed, I made a deliberate decision to re‑engineer my career and return to school for formal business education.

#### Return to Academia: Business Education

As I watched the semiconductor industry become increasingly commoditized, I recognized the need to reinvent myself professionally. While uncertain about the exact direction, I began exploring MBA programs around 2007. My first serious look was at the McCombs School of Business at UT Austin, but I chose to pause that plan so my wife could prioritize and navigate her own career inflection points. As she progressed, my own curiosity shifted toward programs at MIT, including the LGO‑style blend of engineering and management, and the idea of returning to school began to feel more concrete.

A key step was relocating from Texas to the Boston area, in part because it offered an unusually dense concentration of business schools—from MIT and Harvard to Babson and Bentley—within a single ecosystem. Even so, by 2014–2015 I still felt caught between options, unsure how to translate my semiconductor and EDA experience into a new path, until I discovered the inaugural cohort of Harvard Business School Online and decided to enroll. Working through several of those courses, I realized how much I enjoyed the structured study of business models, strategy, and value creation, and that business education could be more than just a credential for me.

In 2016, I committed fully by enrolling in the two‑year MBA program at Babson College. The program operated like a hybrid full‑time experience: I was carrying a demanding engineering role, a rigorous course load, and family responsibilities, all against a fixed two‑year timeline. Those years went by in a blur of classes, team projects, engineering deadlines, and early‑morning and late‑evening drives to my daughter's school and activities.

In early 2018, I left my role at Analog Devices to focus on finishing the MBA and supporting things at home, and I completed the program on schedule. After graduating, I pushed hard to pivot away from pure semiconductor engineering, exploring roles on the business side of the industry and beyond, but the transition proved slower and more difficult than expected. During this period, I interned and volunteered with an angel investing group, gaining practical exposure to deal‑flow management and building a network in the venture and private‑equity ecosystem, even as it remained a challenging field to break into full‑time.

In 2020, as the pandemic unfolded, I made the decision to return to engineering to restore a stable income. I took an engineering role at IBM Research while carrying a substantial federal student loan from business school, which I have been repaying steadily and on schedule. Even though I could pay it off faster, I set myself a constraint: I want to clear that loan when my role reflects the effort and sacrifice that went into retraining between 2015 and 2020.

Today, in 2026, I continue to work as an individual contributor, operating close to the technical details rather than ownership of management processes. Most of what I see relates to internal processes—how supply chains run, how technical operations are structured, and how work actually moves through large engineering organizations—so the business material I studied tends to surface as background context, not as something I directly control. That mix—deep technical work, solid business training, and limited formal authority—is the lens through which I look at my career now, and it shapes how I think about what a better‑aligned next step might need to look like. I am actively looking to move beyond an individual‑contributor role into work that has more influence over management processes and gives me meaningful, in‑the‑field exposure to how business strategy is actually formed and executed.
