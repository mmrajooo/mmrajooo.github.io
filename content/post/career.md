I believe I am very fortunate to have graduated with three Masters Degree's. Looking back
as to how crazy and naughty I was in school, it would certainly give a heart attack to most
of my teachers in Middle and High school. The common theme in all my academics has been
that I almost all the time persued the subjects of my personal interest at those times.
The second aspect as been that I have been directed well in my early academic career and was 
able to use that technique in my later career too.

My initial schooling was done in the schools of the [Indian Education
Society](http://www.ies.edu),specifically the schools which are today called as
[Padmakar Dhamdhere English Medium Primary School](http://iespdemp.in/) and the [V. N.
Sule Guruji English Medium School](http://www.iesvns.com/) alternatively also
reffered to as King George OR Raja Shivaji Vidyasankul. I have always been in
English Medium or English Immersion School as they call it here state side. 

I later joined the [Elphinstone College](https://www.elphinstone.ac.in/) to complete my 
high-school and the initial two years of under graduate school, followed by graduation in 
Physics from [Mithibai College](http://www.mithibai.ac.in/Department%20of%20Physics/M__471). 
both affilated to the [University of Mumbai](http://www.mu.ac.in/)

A major turning point in my career was the *Lectures in Graduate Physics* which
were conducted by the [Homi Bhabha Center for Science
Education](http://www.hbcse.tifr.res.in/). These lectures laid the basic
foundation of solving problems in Physics and Mathematics and put me on a sound foundation  to
understand Relativity, Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity. [PadmaShri
Prof Arvind Kumar](http://www.hbcse.tifr.res.in/people/visiting-scientists/arvind-kumar)
was a key mentor and influencer during the time along with [Prof H. C.
Pradhan](http://www.hbcse.tifr.res.in/people/former-members/hcpradhan) and the
other faculty at the center. The learnings at the center enabled me to qualify
the IIT Bombay Physics Entrance. 

I joined the Masters program in Physics in IIT Bombay in 1994. I high points in
the course was my summer internship at the [Society for Applied Microwave
Electronics Engineering and Research/ SAMEER](https://www.sameer.gov.in/) where
I assisted fellow scientist [Prakash
Suratkar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prakash-suratkar-45237a7/) in his work on
infrared lasers.  This internship also introduced me to the condensed matter
physics group at the [Tata Institute of Fundamental
Research](http://www.tifr.res.in/~dcmpms/index.php), then led by [Prof B. M.
Arora](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/bmarora) Some of the fellow
students of the IITB Engineering Physics program were also key in my later
career notably [Mayur
Joshi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mayur-vinod-joshi-9996182) and [Ashish
Thapliyal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashishthapliyal/)
The comprehensive mutual support in the "M.Sc. Physics Team" enabled almost all of us to crack the GATE 1996 exam,
with very high percentile scores, which enabled all of us into the applied sciences. 
I was able to secure a seat in the IIT Bombay Electrical Engineering, IIT Madras Material Science and also a PhD seat in the 
Experimental Condensed Matter Physics group in TIFR. 
I worked on developing a experimental setup for measuring Photoconductivty  of Diamond Thin Films developed in the department laboratory by
then student [Tarun Sharda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarunsharda/).

I joined the Masters program in in Microelectronics/Electrical Engineering at IIT Bombay in 1996. 
Besides the usual coursework, there were no major high points in the program. I worked on a project to model
the endurance of flash memory devices, which was initially sponsored by [Intel](https://www.intel.com/), 
but later ran out of support. I graduated in early 1998.

I landed in a job in a Semiconductor Firm called *Duet Technologies*, which later was acquired by Motorola and later Freescale Semiconductor. 
Over the 20 or so years since graduating I evolved into a Digital Design Automation specialist with almost no academic digressions in terms
of science and technology in the time. 

My recent academic experience evolved as I saw the semiconductor industry commoditizing and my intent on re-inventing myself. I was a little bit 
uncertain how to shape my career but I started looking into MBA programs since 2007, when I was a a McCombs
