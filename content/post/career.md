I've been fortunate to earn multiple graduate degrees across different disciplines. Looking back at my journey—from being the troublemaker who would have given my middle and high school teachers heart attacks, to becoming a lifelong learner—the common thread has been pursuing subjects that genuinely fascinated me. Early in my career, I received excellent mentorship that taught me how to navigate academic environments, a skill I've applied throughout my professional life.

I am proud to be an alumnus of [UC Berkeley Haas School of Business](https://haas.berkeley.edu/), [F.W. Olin Graduate School of Business at Babson College](https://www.babson.edu/academics/graduate-school/), [Harvard Business School Online](https://online.hbs.edu/), [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/), and [The University of Mumbai](http://www.mu.ac.in/).

## Early Education in Mumbai

I began my education in Mumbai at schools operated by the [Indian Education Society](http://www.ies.edu), specifically [Padmakar Dhamdhere English Medium Primary School](http://iespdemp.in/) and [V. N. Sule Guruji English Medium School](http://www.iesvns.com/) (also known as King George or Raja Shivaji Vidyasankul). All my schooling was conducted in English—what we call English-medium education in India, similar to English immersion programs in the United States.

## Undergraduate Studies in Physics

I continued my education at [Elphinstone College](https://www.elphinstone.ac.in/), where I completed high school and the first two years of undergraduate studies. I then earned my Bachelor's degree in Physics from [Mithibai College](http://www.mithibai.ac.in/Department%20of%20Physics/M__471). Both colleges are affiliated with the [University of Mumbai](http://www.mu.ac.in/).

## The Turning Point: Graduate Physics Lectures

A pivotal moment came through the *Lectures in Graduate Physics* program at the [Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education](http://www.hbcse.tifr.res.in/). These lectures provided rigorous training in problem-solving techniques for physics and mathematics, establishing a solid foundation for understanding relativity, quantum mechanics, and general relativity. [Padma Shri Prof. Arvind Kumar](http://www.hbcse.tifr.res.in/people/visiting-scientists/arvind-kumar) was a key mentor during this period, along with [Prof. H. C. Pradhan](http://www.hbcse.tifr.res.in/people/former-members/hcpradhan) and other faculty members. This training proved instrumental in helping me qualify for the highly competitive IIT Bombay Physics entrance examination. 

## Master's in Physics at IIT Bombay (1994-1996)

I enrolled in the Master's program in Physics at [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/) in 1994. A highlight of the program was my summer internship at the [Society for Applied Microwave Electronics Engineering and Research (SAMEER)](https://www.sameer.gov.in/), where I assisted scientist [Prakash Suratkar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prakash-suratkar-45237a7/) in his research on infrared lasers. This internship also connected me with the condensed matter physics group at the [Tata Institute of Fundamental Research](http://www.tifr.res.in/~dcmpms/index.php), then led by [Prof. B. M. Arora](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/bmarora).

The collaborative environment among my cohort—particularly with fellow students [Mayur Joshi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mayur-vinod-joshi-9996182) and [Ashish Thapliyal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashishthapliyal/)—proved invaluable. Our "M.Sc. Physics Team" supported each other through rigorous preparation, and nearly all of us achieved high percentile scores on the GATE 1996 exam, opening doors to applied sciences programs. I was accepted into IIT Bombay's Electrical Engineering program, IIT Madras's Materials Science program, and also received a PhD position in the Experimental Condensed Matter Physics group at TIFR. During this period, I developed an experimental setup for measuring photoconductivity of diamond thin films, working alongside doctoral student [Tarun Sharda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarunsharda/).

## Master's in Microelectronics/Electrical Engineering at IIT Bombay (1996-1998)

In 1996, I enrolled in the Master's program in Microelectronics/Electrical Engineering at [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/). Beyond the standard coursework, I worked on a research project modeling the endurance of flash memory devices. The project was initially sponsored by [Intel](https://www.intel.com/) but later lost funding. I completed the program and graduated in early 1998.

## Early Career in Semiconductors

After graduation, I joined a semiconductor firm called *Duet Technologies*, which was subsequently acquired by Motorola and later became part of Freescale Semiconductor. Over the next two decades, I developed deep expertise in Digital Design Automation, focusing primarily on industry work rather than continuing formal academic studies in science and technology during this period. 

## Return to Academia: Business Education

As I watched the semiconductor industry become increasingly commoditized, I recognized the need to reinvent myself professionally. While uncertain about the exact direction, I began exploring MBA programs around 2007. My journey started when I was
