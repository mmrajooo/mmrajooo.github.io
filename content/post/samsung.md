Question: 
How can Samsung, the leader in memory chips, address the threat posed by Chinese competition in the upcoming cyclical industry downturn  ?

Strategy (1): (Self)Disruptive Innovation.
	Samsung’s core strength is in high performance high tech innovation, so it should focus its strategy towards that aspect. One way to avoid disruption, is to spinoff some of its hi-tech innovation and design teams into an independent company or business unit and have it research and innovate in new technologies. This will accelerate its innovation and will help it keep itself ahead of the industry innovation curve and hence surpass the chinese competition.

Strategy (2): Expand into China
	Samsung, could tighten its controls on designs/blueprints at the same time it could open up manufacturing in China, and share and increase the pie of the memory design in collaboration with the chinese manufacturing industry. They could have the focus on the high tech products in Korea, but move all its low margin, old products to china

Strategy (3): Stay as is keep innovating, but exit from select sectors.
	Samsung can continue on its existing strategy and focus on new innovations and high tech and high performance memory for high margin markets. They should exit out of the sectors 

where they have little or no margin and in which they see competition with the chinese manufacturers

Situation
Chinese firms pose a threat by large scale entry into the memory chip industry. 

Complexity
Chinese competition, issues hurting Samsung
●	don't have to spend a lot on R&D as they compete for older products
●	can raise required finance, from local and international sources
●	New-tech substitute, has potential to disrupt large memory design houses if they stick to old devices
●	having  partnerships with international companies, for manufacturing in China, (eg Infineon, Elpida,Motorola)

Enablers
Chinese competition, issues beneficial to Samsung
●	Producing on older products(in high tech industry).
●	lack organizational and tactic experience
●	Very expensive PP&E however not impossible, 
●	DIfficulty to obtain state of the art equipment form Industry leaders in USA
●	Have no in-house expertise to “design” the memory chips
Samsung intrinsic enablers, 
●	Design optimization with partners like Rambus, to reduce production complexity and cost of Manufacturing
●	Drive towards excellence in quality of products. 
●	Drive towards excellence in company organization (HR)
