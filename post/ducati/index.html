              <p><strong>This Blog is still under heavy contruction&hellip;  I hope to go live soon in Aug 2019 Io

<p>The Ducati Case Study<sup>1</sup> by <a href="https://store.hbr.org/search.php?search_query=Giovanni%20Gavetti&amp;section=product">Giovanni
Gavetti</a>,
focuses on the turnaround and strategic repositioning of Ducati, an Italian
maker of high-end sport motorcycles, and describes the current concerns with
the growth prospects of the company. Federico Minoli, the CEO and strategic
mind behind the turnaround, knew that Ducati could not grow indefinitely in its
current niche. One alternative was to attack Harley Davidson&rsquo;s niche with a
Ducati interpretation of a cruiser.</p>
<p>The analysis below tries to answer the following questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>What was the fundamental logic behind Minoli’s actions to turn Ducati around?</li>
<li>What was the underlying economic logic of Minoli’s turnaround?</li>
<li>Can Ducati sustain its current growth in the sports segment? Can key competitors take counter actions to reduce Ducati’s growth prospects?</li>
<li>What are Minoli’s strategic options in 2001?</li>
<li>Which would you recommend? (I expect you to back your recommendations with hard data)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ducati-case-analysis">Ducati Case Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Ducati, was a company established in 1926, and over the years it
established its brand in the industry. The company underwent a number of
management changes over the years, and was on the verge of getting Bankrupt in
1996 when it was acquired by the American Equity Firm Texas Pacific Group. TPG.
Partner, Abel Helpern responsible for the acquisition appointed his former
colleague and friend from Bain &amp; Co, Fedrico Minoli as the new CEO of
Ducati. Minioli's main job was to bring the company out of Bankruptcy, and
turn it around.</p>
<p><strong>Fundamental Logic behind Minoli's actions to turn Ducati around (1996)</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Basics.</strong></p>
<p>The basic goal of the new owners, which Minoli was working towards, was
to transform or enhance the Ducati Brand as a high-end niche product. Ducati
was already a &quot;sports niche&quot; product, Ducati engineering was
excellent and had evolved in the Bologna area of Italy which is also the home
to other niche performance brands or automobiles like Ferrari, Lamborghini.
Maserati, etc. In Minoli's view the Ducati product was very unique and
offered &quot;beautiful performance&quot; in spite of being less efficient and
reliable compared to the competition. Ducati also had excellent engineers in</p>
<p><img src="/img/duc00-ex6.png" alt="Annotated Exhibit 6" /></p>
<p>its R&amp;D and Racing divisions, whose main focus was to defeat the Japanese
Bikes in the Superbike championships (Exhibit 6 1990-96). Lastly Ducati had
excellent brand loyalty however only in Europe, over 55% of former owners would
buy a Ducati again. Ducati relative to its competition was only in one segment
of the market, the knee-down/performance riders. It had huge potential being a
specialty niche in the segment.</p>
<p><strong>The Market and Strategic Positioning</strong></p>
<p>The market for motorcycles is large and can be divided into
multiple segments based on a Performance-Comfort vs Function-Lifestyle matrix.
(Exhibit 4).</p>
<p><img src="/img/duc01-ex4.png" alt="Annotated Exhibit 4" /></p>
<p>Ducati in 1996 was present only in the sports/performance segment, and all the
other competing companies are present in all or more than a few segments. The
Japanese manufacturers Honda, Yamaha, Suzuki and Kawasaki were present in all
the segments. BMW the German manufacturer was focused on the touring bike
segment in the comfort segments, they did however offer a bike in each of the
other two segments. Triumph the British manufacturer was mainly focused in the
Functional Segments. Harley the American manufacturer was present mostly in the
Performance-Lifestyle segment, but with the highest profit margin in the
industry. Minoli's strategic focus initially is to bring back the company
from its current financial situation and be poised to expand into this segment
due to the higher profit margins and as it already has large engine high
performance motorcycles is relatively easier to penetrate if Ducati's brand
identity could be enhanced further.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Logic underlying Minoli's turnaround (1996 and later)</strong></p>
<p>In spite of the niceties we talked about Ducati in the sports/racing field, the
total market share was way behind the Japanese competition, and lesser than the
brands of BMW and Harley-Davidson (Exhibit 3) especially in 1996 at the time of
TPG acquisition.</p>
<p><img src="/img/duc02-ex3.png" alt="Annotated Exhibit 3" /></p>
<p>We discussed Minoli's fundamental strategic focus earlier. Economically he
set forth the goal to grow at double digits and match the profitability of
Harley Davidson which was highest in the industry (no financial data is
provided in the case for Harley Davidson). The first economic aspect was to
increase the market exposure and potentially enhance the company's global
market share, so he decided to go global and also attempted to increase the
brand's influence in other market sectors. The second economic aspect of
the strategy was to increase the Willingness To Pay for its customers, to
achieve this he decided to build and enhance the Ducati brand, and undertook a
number of activities to achieve this. He built the Ducati Museum in Bologna,
and spread awareness of the Ducati brand globally using advertising campaigns
like the &quot;Ducati/People&quot;; engaging in co-marketing efforts with major
international brands like Neiman Marcus, DKNY, Harrods and Sotheby's;
entering the accessories and apparel business by acquisition of Gio.Ca.Moto and
partnering with Dianese; started Ducati Owner clubs.</p>
<p>The third economic aspect was to improve the cost structure and financial
efficiency of the manufacturing and distribution process and have a broader
product strategy to reach out to a wider customer base as envisioned earlier.
They introduced the ST2 and ST4 in the sport-touring market segment and later
introduced the MH900 Evolution, and MH996R as limited production high margin
products exclusively from its website. They also entered the business of
accessories and apparel as mentioned earlier, only Harley Davidson was a
competitor in that product domain. They increased the outsourcing of production
parts from 80% to 87% (chasing a 90% target), they improved production from 76
bikes/employee to 87 bikes/employee. They switched from long term supplier
contracts to short term ones, and identified alternative suppliers for various
parts so they could maintain a price pressure on the suppliers by switching
between them. They invested in taking control of distribution in strategic
markets by establishing fully owned subsidiaries, optimized the existing
distribution channels, by increasing their presence at each dealer but reducing
the number of dealers, and lastly by establishing signature stores, where
customers could get premium experience and support for Ducati branded products.</p>
<p>A special note of mention is also their smart online marketing efforts at
Ducati.com as early as 2000, with reference to the &quot;Network Effects&quot;,<sup>2</sup>
it's interesting to note the quote from Christiano Silei that
&quot;The Internet is first of all a great instrument to communicate to our
virtual visitors our racing and Italian identity. Consider that we estimate
that only 43% of our hits come from current customers. But the Internet is also
an incredible mechanism to understand their needs, their psychology. Apart from
the usual chatrooms, email etcetera, we regularly conduct on-line polls, market
surveys. The response rate is always impressive. And we take them into account
for our decisions. Finally, <em>the Internet creates a community. These people
talk to each other, they feel part of something&hellip;.</em> &quot;</p>
<p>The Network Effect, is basically the propagation of product marketing
through peer-peer social interactions between customers in the market. I
understand the company did not invest heavily in ecommerce but only sold
accessories and apparel the limited &quot;collectors&quot; models exclusively
on their website as mentioned earlier.</p>
<p><strong>Sustaining growth in the sports segment (2001 and beyond)</strong></p>
<p>The following is a visualization of the sports segment market share
over the years, for the European market</p>
<p><img src="/img/duc03-europe.png" alt="Europe" /></p>
<p>and this is for the World market</p>
<p><img src="/img/duc04-world.png" alt="World" /></p>
<p>One can observe that the market share for Ducati, has slightly increased over the years, however this is still very small relative to the Japanese manufacturers. In spite of the positive changes, the company has not really made any big inroads in to the market share of the Japanese manufacturers, it however has definitely captured the market from BMW and Harley Davidson as seen again in Exibit 3 in the year 2000.</p>
<p><img src="/img/duc05-ex3.png" alt="Annotated Exhibit 3.2" /></p>
<p>The other metric to look at is the financials of the company.</p>
<p><img src="/img/duc06-ex1.png" alt="Annotated Exhibit 1" /></p>
<p>The calculated rows (pink) show the year on year growth in net income and market share. One can deduce that the strategy deployed by Minoli has worked very well, and the company is having a sustained year on year growth.</p>
<p><strong>SWOT Analysis / 2001 / Sports Segment</strong></p>
<p><img src="/img/duc07-swot.png" alt="Swot" /></p>
<p>There are almost no new incremental opportunities, in the sports segment, the momentum of the last 2~3 years will be beneficial for the segment and will results only in marginal gains and the growth would slow down for Ducati. There is also a threat that the extensive Japanese competition could innovate and suddenly eat into the growing market share. It should be noted that the Japanese manufacturers are very diverse in their industry footprint and have better leverage if they re-strategize themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Minoli’s strategic options in 2001</strong></p>
<p>We should again look back at what Minoli started with in 1996. We can basically see that the market is still the same except that Ducati has returned to profitability, increased its efficiency and become a more global player in the market segment it was already in, expanded a bit into the comfort market with its Sport Touring products and has created a remarkable Brand Identity for itself.
Minoli hence has 3 more options,</p>
<ul>
<li>at a minimum, he can increase the presence in the sport touring segment, next</li>
<li>he can expand into the Harley niche with performance lifestyle models, or</li>
<li>he can invest to develop lower-performance models and enter the easy riders market.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/img/duc08-ex4.png" alt="Annotated Exhibit 4.2" /></p>
<p><strong>My Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The momentum built in to product growth under Minoli’s turnaround strategy will contribute positively to Ducati. In my opinion he should definitely increase his footprint in the sport-touring segment, however since this market is already dominated by a majority of the players, there will be little to gain, instead he should focus mainly in the Performance/Lifestyle domain, which is currently dominated by Harley Davidson.</p>
<p>There are two factors here in play the first is the Brand Loyalty. We can see from Exhibit 16 of the case that it has increased positively for Harley Davidson and Ducati and a small bit for Kawasaki. This will play a huge role in preferring to expand in the cruiser market with Harley Davidson. Harley being a American Brand, it will be hard to break into its domain in the US, however it would be relatively easy to break into the European market</p>
<p><img src="/img/duc09-ex16.png" alt="Annotated Exhibit 16" /></p>
<p>The second factor in plays is the cost structure of Ducati vs Harley Davidson, as demonstrated in Exhibit 12 of the case.</p>
<p><img src="/img/duc10-ex12.png" alt="Annotated Exhibit 12" /></p>
<p>We can see that cost structure of Ducati has definitely improved compared to 1996, however its Fixed Sales Costs and G&amp;A are still relatively much higher in percentage than Harley Davidson. Minoli should take strict steps in the right direction to reduce the fixed sales costs and G&amp;A. One of the ways this could be done is increasing the accessories and apparel business in a more European strategized way. Ducati being a European company I would say has a better understanding of the customer
sentiment than the American company. The company is trying to move into the “lifestyle” segment so that means more marketing than technical/performance investment is needed.</p>
