            <article>
              <p>The other day, I was on a call with a friend at ARM and we slipped our conversation on RISC-V.</p>
<p>RISC-V is a opensourced microprocessor architecture specification started by University of California Berkeley
and is a direct threat to companies like ARM which have legacy IP cores which are very successful in the current
market of small devices and tablets.</p>
<p>ARM sells a microprocessor core IP of various sizes and for various applications.</p>
<p>So is RISC-V a threat to ARM ?
Yesterday I read and tweeted an article about Microsoft and Linux, which was in a similar vein back in 2001 and now.
&ndash; write about the article &ndash;</p>
<p>So how should ARM deal with this threat ?
ARM should not think of RISC-V as a threat. The management in ARM should understand that it has been a long time
that ARM has enjoyed being a monopoly in the market with it being the biggest and only player in the domain of
MIPS, Lexra. It has to think very similat to how Microsoft is thinking of Linux today instead of thinking it as
a challenge. The monopoly over the years has probably manifested into probably some architecture issues of ARM which
have been worked on and worked around over time in software. The pressure of achiveing the best lowpower, speed and area,
are probably what lead to the development of RISCV. There are a few options of for ARM, it can go about its business as
usual and face the doom similar to the ones suggested by Prof. Clayton Christiansons theory.</p>
<p>It can re-innovate and go back and fix and tune its current architecure to meet the demands of its customers, and
optimize or re-engineer its own architecture. This is what they are probably doing now. This though is a great option is
still perhaps similar to upgrading from mule-drawn carriages to better fed horse drawn carriages.</p>
<p>The bolder option in my opinion is however to adopt RISC-V as it is opensource and leverage the benefits it offers
to replace some of the pieces of its own architecture which have fallen behind. This is a story similar to what multiple
people have tried before. It startes with some market research and find out and identify what portions of its microprocessor
portfolio provide REAL value to its customers. Once these key factors are identified, it is very important that they
start a &ldquo;new&rdquo; team of business unit, which does not have any legacy ARM bias or culture, and empower them to use RISC-V as the
main core and develop the &ldquo;REAL value adds&rdquo; and any other feedback they understand from their customers, as extensions and bolt-ons
to the main RISC-V core. This strategy would help bolster ARM&rsquo;s current non-up/uc portfolio as well as prepare itself to</p>
<p>they should learn and understand the
RISC-V architecture and consider the benefits that it offers.</p>
<p>Before we think of this as a doom or a boom we should see</p>
<p>In the good old days of the last century and early this century I used to run a small blog
or a resource page about VLSI (Very Large Scale Integrated) circuit design and resources.
The domain was pretty new in the time and there were very little resources available at the time.
The technology is developing fast, however the industry is commoditized and disaapearing to the east.
