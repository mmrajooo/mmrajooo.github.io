Newell Company: Corporate Strategy</p>
<p>9-799-139
REV: JANUARY 31, 2005</p>
<p>Newell Company: Corporate Strategy,
Mayuresh Rajwadkar
Core Question:
Can Newell extend its expertise in acquiring, streamlining and managing small companies, to the acquisition of the giant and mismanaged Rubbermaid ?
R1: Revamping Management and Operations
Rubbermaid has had a number of management and operations issues at time of acquisition, Joe and his management team, should reshuffle the management team which comes over from Rubbermaid, and strategically layoff and cut staff with an aim to make it more profitable. The management which stays after the restructuring should undergo a through training to realign with the strategy and goals of Newell. The Product portfolio and operations also should be reconsidered and should be strategically cut down in order to optimize cost vs sales. Newell has a very disciplined and successful strategy with product management and operations and should be applied to all the Rubbermaid products, after the merger. A cut on the product portfolio will also improve the performance of the operations and overall customer experience.
R2: Improving Customer Service
Hand in hand with R1, the company should focus on improving its relationship with its customers. In the case the existing customers are not satisfied with Rubbermaid at the time of its acquisition. Newell, should  work with them closely, to bring back confidence and convince them that the support would improve with the new management. Newell should also make an extra effort to reach out to the customers who already have left and try to renegotiate to bring them back into their portfolio with Rubbermaid.
R3: Improving supply chain management and production efficacy.
Newell, with its bigger size after the acquisition, can have better leverage in negotiating with theits supply chains. This will help in reducing production costs not only for Rubbermaid but also for its other product lines. A reduced cost structure will help the company compete better in the market. A reduced cost structure will also help the company refine its production efficiency and complement its customer service experience. Joe, and his management team should be insistant to use this leverage<br />
initially with all the Rubbermaid products, and later as they seem fit on its other product lines.</p>
<p>Situation:
Newell is primarily looking to grow the company with a goal of sales and eps growth of 15% a year, and ROE of 20% and above. To achieve this they have been having a strategy of acquiring companies. For most part they have been acquiring small companies and making them more efficient. Over the years they have come to the understanding that they need to reach a market cap greater than $10Bil, to achieve the high growth rates they are trying to achieve. The case is about the time they are going to cross the $10Bil threshold during the period they acquired Calphalon and Rubbermaid. The Rubbermaid acquisition is the main big one, almost at the size of Newell. Newell revenues at the time of acquisition are about $3.2Bil vs $2.4Bil for Rubbermaid, it was a much larger company to integrate for Newell, relative to its earlier acquisition, however it was the one which would help get Newell to go about the $10B market cap. Newell had been a consistent performer in the former years of the acquisition, however Rubbermaid was a struggling company, profitable yet with declining profits.
Complexities:
Newell has never acquired a company as big as Rubbermaid as yet
Rubbermaid has been struggling on various fronts in the year prior to the acquisition,
They have operational issues (not delivering on time)
They have supply chain issues( cannot manage resin price increases)
They have growth issues ( reduced profitability )
Rubbermaid being a big company, there is a risk of it cannibalizing on Newells resources as it merges operations with Newell
Enablers:
Newell has a number of years of successful experience acquiring and integrating companies
Newell’s financials are strong at the time of acquisition, and more forward looking.
Calphalon and Rubbermaid acquisitions bring very good brand-names to Newells portfolio
The total market cap of Newell goes above 10Bil, with these acquisitions, which would give it more control over its eps growth.</p>
<p>Question:
Can Newell extend its expertise in acquiring, streamlining and managing small companies, to the acquisition of the giant and mismanaged Rubbermaid ?</p>
