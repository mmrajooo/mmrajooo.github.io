      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is about words used in this blog, so I will keep updating it
as I find significant words. I would have called this a glossary but well
it is about words and I used to love the word &amp;ldquo;Lemma&amp;rdquo; growing up with Mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;huh

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the good old days of the last century and early this century I used to run a small blog
or a resource page about VLSI (Very Large Scale Integrated) circuit design and resources.
The blog is still hosted on blogspot but I have stopped maintaining it. This post summarizes
some of its relevant content which may still be useful for folks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
