Looking back at my journey—from being the troublemaker who would have given my middle and high school teachers heart attacks, to becoming a lifelong learner—the common thread has been pursuing subjects that genuinely fascinated me. Early in my career, I received excellent mentorship that taught me how to navigate academic environments, a skill I&amp;rsquo;ve applied throughout my professional life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am proud to be an alumnus of &lt;a href="https://haas.berkeley.edu/"&gt;UC Berkeley Haas School of Business&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.babson.edu/academics/graduate-school/"&gt;F.W. Olin Graduate School of Business at Babson College&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://online.hbs.edu/"&gt;Harvard Business School Online&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in/"&gt;Indian Institute of Technology Bombay&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.mu.ac.in/"&gt;The University of Mumbai&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Open Source Designs and EDA</title><link>https://www.rajwadkar.us/post/opensourceeda/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.rajwadkar.us/post/opensourceeda/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A majority of the IC designs are proprietary and confidential and are owned by the major players in the market. In the recent years there has been resurgence in Open Source IP, the most notable being the &lt;a href="https://riscv.org/"&gt;RISC-V&lt;/a&gt; processor, which is a great thing as the low power processor market has practically become a monopoly of the &lt;a href="https://www.arm.com"&gt;ARM&lt;/a&gt; processor. This post is a collection on various resources which are open source and free to use.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Vagabond</title><link>https://www.rajwadkar.us/post/vagabond/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.rajwadkar.us/post/vagabond/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I had studied this poem by R. L. Stevenson when I was in high school, it was my favorite and is a great source of
inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

Gavetti&lt;/a&gt;,
focuses on the turnaround and strategic repositioning of Ducati, an Italian
maker of high-end sport motorcycles, and describes the current concerns with
the growth prospects of the company. Federico Minoli, the CEO and strategic
mind behind the turnaround, knew that Ducati could not grow indefinitely in its
current niche. One alternative was to attack Harley Davidson&amp;rsquo;s niche with a
Ducati interpretation of a cruiser.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>VLSI Design</title><link>https://www.rajwadkar.us/post/vlsiinfo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.rajwadkar.us/post/vlsiinfo/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In the good old days of the last century and early this century I used to run a small blog
or a resource page about VLSI (Very Large Scale Integrated) circuit design and resources.
The domain was pretty new in the time and there were very little resources available at the time.
The technology is developing fast, however the industry is commoditized and disaapearing to the east.
The &lt;a href="http://mayursvlsiinfopage.blogspot.com/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; is still hosted on blogspot but I have stopped maintaining it. This post summarizes some of its relevant content which may still be useful for folks.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
