      <description>&lt;p&gt;I believe I am very fortunate to have graduated with three Masters Degree&amp;rsquo;s. Looking back
as to how crazy and naughty I was in school, it would certainly give a heart attack to most
of my teachers in Middle and High school. The common theme in all my academics has been
that I almost all the time persued the subjects of my personal interest at those times.
The second aspect as been that I have been directed well in my early academic career and was
able to use that technique in my later career too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My first exposure to business was when I was probably in middle and high school.
My dad worked as a engineer most of his life in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.siemens.com/in/en/home.html&#34;&gt;Siemens India&lt;/a&gt; and left his job
to establish his own venture to consult and implement industrial power systems and switchgear
in Mumbai in the eighties.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is about words used in this blog, so I will keep updating it
as I find significant words. I would have called this a glossary but well
it is about words and I used to love the word &amp;ldquo;Lemma&amp;rdquo; growing up with Mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
