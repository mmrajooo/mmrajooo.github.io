In the recent years there has been resurgence in Open Source IP, the most notable being the &lt;a href="https://riscv.org/"&gt;RISC-V&lt;/a&gt; processor, which is a great thing as the low power processor market has practically become a monopoly of the &lt;a href="https://www.arm.com"&gt;ARM&lt;/a&gt; processor. This post is a collection on various resources which are open source and free to use.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Garage Sale</title><link>https://www.rajwadkar.us/contact/garagesale/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.rajwadkar.us/contact/garagesale/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Over the years I have collected a number of things and am looking to get rid of them

Gavetti&lt;/a&gt;,
focuses on the turnaround and strategic repositioning of Ducati, an Italian
maker of high-end sport motorcycles, and describes the current concerns with
the growth prospects of the company. Federico Minoli, the CEO and strategic
mind behind the turnaround, knew that Ducati could not grow indefinitely in its
current niche. One alternative was to attack Harley Davidson&amp;rsquo;s niche with a
Ducati interpretation of a cruiser.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>https://www.rajwadkar.us/about/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Nov 2016 21:05:33 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://www.rajwadkar.us/about/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;An sincerity so extremity he additions.

or a resource page about VLSI (Very Large Scale Integrated) circuit design and resources.
The domain was pretty new in the time and there were very little resources available at the time.
The technology is developing fast, however the industry is commoditized and disaapearing to the east.
The &lt;a href="http://mayursvlsiinfopage.blogspot.com/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; is still hosted on blogspot but I have stopped maintaining it. This post summarizes some of its relevant content which may still be useful for folks.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
