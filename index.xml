      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had studied this poem by R. L. Stevenson when I was in high school, it was my favorite and is a great source of
inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Ducati Case Study&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.hbr.org/search.php?search_query=Giovanni%20Gavetti&amp;amp;section=product&#34;&gt;Giovanni
Gavetti&lt;/a&gt;,
focuses on the turnaround and strategic repositioning of Ducati, an Italian
maker of high-end sport motorcycles, and describes the current concerns with
the growth prospects of the company. Federico Minoli, the CEO and strategic
mind behind the turnaround, knew that Ducati could not grow indefinitely in its
current niche. One alternative was to attack Harley Davidson&amp;rsquo;s niche with a
Ducati interpretation of a cruiser.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>VLSI Design</title>
      <link>https://www.rajwadkar.us/post/vlsiinfo/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the good old days of the last century and early this century I used to run a small blog
or a resource page about VLSI (Very Large Scale Integrated) circuit design and resources.
The domain was pretty new in the time and there were very little resources available at the time.
The technology is developing fast, however the industry is commoditized and disaapearing to the east.
The &lt;a href=&#34;http://mayursvlsiinfopage.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;  is still hosted on blogspot but I have stopped maintaining it. This post summarizes some of its relevant content which may still be useful for folks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
