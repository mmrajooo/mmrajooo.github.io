&lt;p&gt;I had studied this poem by R. L. Stevenson when I was in high school, it was my favorite and is a great source of
inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This Blog is still under heavy contruction&amp;hellip;  I hope to go live soon in Aug 2019 In the meantime I have my old blog all  summarised in this one post here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the good old days of the last century and early this century I used to run a small blog
or a resource page about VLSI (Very Large Scale Integrated) circuit design and resources.
The domain was pretty new in the time and there were very little resources available at the time.
The technology is developing fast, however the industry is commoditized and disaapearing to the east.
The &lt;a href=&#34;http://mayursvlsiinfopage.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;  is still hosted on blogspot but I have stopped maintaining it. This post summarizes some of its relevant content which may still be useful for folks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
