      <description>&lt;p&gt;A majority of the IC designs are proprietary and confidential and are owned by the major players in the market. In the  recent years there has been resurgence in Open Source IP, the most notable being the &lt;a href=&#34;https://riscv.org/&#34;&gt;RISC-V&lt;/a&gt; processor, which is a great thing as the low power processor market has practically become a monopoly of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.arm.com&#34;&gt;ARM&lt;/a&gt; processor. This post is a collection on various resources which are open source and free to use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>VLSI Design</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the good old days of the last century and early this century I used to run a small blog
or a resource page about VLSI (Very Large Scale Integrated) circuit design and resources.
The domain was pretty new in the time and there were very little resources available at the time.
The technology is developing fast, however the industry is commoditized and disaapearing to the east.
The &lt;a href=&#34;http://mayursvlsiinfopage.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;  is still hosted on blogspot but I have stopped maintaining it. This post summarizes some of its relevant content which may still be useful for folks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
