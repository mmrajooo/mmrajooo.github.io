Looking back at my journey—from being the troublemaker who would have given my middle and high school teachers heart attacks, to becoming a lifelong learner—the common thread has been pursuing subjects that genuinely fascinated me. Early in my career, I received excellent mentorship that taught me how to navigate academic environments, a skill I&amp;rsquo;ve applied throughout my professional life.&lt;/p&gt;
