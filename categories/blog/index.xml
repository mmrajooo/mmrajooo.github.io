      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is about words used in this blog, so I will keep updating it
as I find significant words. I would have called this a glossary but well
it is about words and I used to love the word &amp;ldquo;Lemma&amp;rdquo; growing up with Mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;huh
huh&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>VLSI Information</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the good old days of the last century and early this century I used to run a small blog
or a resource page about VLSI (Very Large Scale Integrated) circuit design and resources.
The domain was pretty new in the time and there were very little resources available at the time.
The technology is developing fast, however the industry is commoditized and disaapearing to the east.
The &lt;a href=&#34;http://mayursvlsiinfopage.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;  is still hosted on blogspot but I have stopped maintaining it. This post summarizes some of its relevant content which may still be useful for folks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
